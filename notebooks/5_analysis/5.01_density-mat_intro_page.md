# Density matrices from hyperfine beat

From the simulated electronic wavepacket, we can analyse the properties in density matrix and real-space representations.

- Basic "Legacy version" uses basic code from [Alignment 3 notebook](https://github.com/phockett/Quantum-Metrology-with-Photoelectrons/blob/master/Alignment/Alignment-3.ipynb). See {ref}`page:denMat`.
- Update version, uses code from this project and ePSproc for analysis. See {ref}`page:denMatUpdated`.

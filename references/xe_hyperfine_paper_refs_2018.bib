The step-like population transfers caused by continual interaction with a sequence of pulses and refractory periods are shown to give rise to time evolution of the photoelectron kinetic energy distribution as the history of molecular electronic and vibrational states. Such a signal should lead to a novel and direct way to investigate electronic and nuclear simultaneous dynamics involving multiple excited states.},

The measured angular distributions for electrons leaving either ion core \{ Pl/2 or I'3/2) are compared with those calculated from multichannel quantum-defect theory. Reasonable agreement is obtained in reproducing the general features of the an-gular distributions for the p and d states in the rare gases. However, discrepancies are observed for some of the s states. Comparison of the measured and calculated branching ratios for leaving either ion core also shows good agreement for the p and d states, but shows that there are inadequacies in the theory for describing the s states.

Characteristic oscillations with periods of 8 ps and 5 ps are observed in the photoelectron signal and attributed to coupling between the initially excited zero-order bright state and two doorway states. Values for the coupling coefficients connecting these three vibrational states have been determined. In addition, an exponential change in photoelectron signal with a lifetime of 17 ps is attributed to weaker couplings with a bath of dark states that play a more significant role during the latter stages of IVR. A tier model has been used to assign the most strongly coupled doorway state to S(1) 17a(1) 6a(2)('), where {$\nu$}(17a) is a CH out-of-plane vibrational mode and 6a(2)(') is a methyl torsional level.

  abstract = {Photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) are obtained for a pair of 4s(1)4p(6)6p(1) (a singlet and a triplet) autoionizing states in atomic krypton. A high-order harmonic pulse is used to excite the pair of states and a time-delayed 801 nm ionization pulse probes the PADs to the final 4s(1)4p(6) continuum with femtosecond time resolution. The ejected electrons are detected with velocity map imaging to retrieve the time-resolved photoelectron spectrum and PADs. The PAD for the triplet state is inherently separable by virtue of its longer autoionization lifetime. Measuring the total signal over time allows for the PADs to be extracted for both the singlet state and the triplet state. Anisotropy parameters for the triplet state are measured to be {$\beta$}(2)=0.55 {\textpm} 0.17 and {$\beta$}(4)=-0.01 {\textpm} 0.10, while the singlet state yields {$\beta$}(2)=2.19 {\textpm} 0.18 and {$\beta$}(4)=1.84 {\textpm} 0.14. For the singlet state, the ratio of radial transition dipole matrix elements, X, of outgoing S to D partial waves and total phase shift difference between these waves, {$\Delta$}, are determined to be X=0.56 {\textpm} 0.08 and {$\Delta$}=2.19 {\textpm} 0.11 rad. The continuum quantum defect difference between the S and D electron partial waves is determined to be -0.15 {\textpm} 0.03 for the singlet state. Based on previous analyses, the triplet state is expected to have anisotropy parameters independent of electron kinetic energy and equal to {$\beta$}(2)=5/7 and {$\beta$}(4)=-12/7. Deviations from the predicted values are thought to be a result of state mixing by spin-orbit and configuration interactions in the intermediate and final states; theoretical calculations are required to quantify these effects.},

Frequency analysis of the beats provides a measurement of the hyperfine splittings in agreement with previous work. The usefulness of quantum-beat detection as a new method of laser spectroscopy without complications from the Doppler effect is discussed. The fluorescent light emitted by an atom pre-pared in a coherent superposition of states by a pulse excitation may exhibit modulations at fre-quencies corresponding to the energy splittings between these states. ' These modulations, called quantum beats, have been detected in many ex-periments over the last ten years, the pulse ex-citation being provided either by an optical pulse, ' a pulsed electron beam, ' or the collision of an atomic beam with a thin carbon target (beam-foil spectroscopy). " In this latter type of experi-ment, high time resolution can be achieved by ob-serving the spatial modulation of the fluorescence along the path of the atoms. As a result, beats at several hundred megahertz arising from the co-herent excitation of fine' and hyperfine' structure levels in various atomic species have been re-cently studied. The optical-pulse quantum-beat experiments' have so far been unable to detect such high-fre-quency modulations. In these experiments, the optical pulses, produced by conventional spectral sources shuttered by a Kerr cell, were rather long (a few hundred nanoseconds). Therefore, all observations have been restricted to the study of very low-frequency (a few megahertz) beat signals, arising from the coherent excitation of Zeeman substates whose degeneracy was removed by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, due to the weakness of the signal, long averaging techniques had to be used to extract the modula-tion from the noise.},

  abstract = {The existence of highly spin polarized photoelectrons emitted from non-magnetic solids as well as from unpolarized atoms and molecules has been found to be very common in many studies over the past 40 years. This so-called Fano effect is based upon the influence of the spin-orbit interaction in the photoionization or the photoemission process. In a non-angle-resolved photoemission experiment, circularly polarized radiation has to be used to create spin polarized photoelectrons, while in angle-resolved photoemission even unpolarized or linearly polarized radiation is sufficient to get a high spin polarization. In past years the Rashba effect has become very important in the angle-resolved photoemission of solid surfaces, also with an observed high photoelectron spin polarization. It is the purpose of the present topical review to cross-compare the spin polarization experimentally found in angle-resolved photoelectron emission spectroscopy of condensed matter with that of free atoms, to compare it with the Rashba effect and topological insulators to describe the influence and the importance of the spin-orbit interaction and to show and disentangle the matrix element and phase shift effects therein.The relationship between the energy dispersion of these phase shifts and the emission delay of photoelectron emission in attosecond-resolved photoemission is also discussed. Furthermore the influence of chiral structures of the photo-effect target on the spin polarization, the interferences of different spin components in coherent superpositions in photoemission and a cross-comparison of spin polarization in photoemission from non-magnetic solids with XMCD on magnetic materials are presented; these are all based upon the influence of the spin-orbit interaction in angle-resolved photoemission.},

I n t r o d u c t i o n For many years interest in the Zeeman effect for free atoms has greatly exceeded the interest in the quadratic Stark effect. The reasons for this situation are clear. Experimentally, the use of high electric fields is much more difficult than th at of high magnetic fields. Furthermore, many of the readily accessible atomic states have total electronic angular momentum J = {\textbackslash} and extremely small Stark split\- tings. Theoretically, the Stark effect suffers in comparison to the Zeeman effect in th at detailed knowledge of the wavefunctions of excited states is required. These objections to the Stark effect now seem much less strong. Recent atomic beam (Haun \& Zacharias 1957; Lipworth \& Sandars 1964), optical double resonance (Blamont 1957) and level crossing experiments (Novick \& Lurio 1965, private communication) suggest very strongly th at it should be possible to measure the quadratic Stark effect with considerable precision in any atomic state for which the hyperfine structure has been determined by one of these methods. On the theoretical side, new methods have been developed (Sternheimer 1954; Schwartz 1959) for treating the infinite sums which occur in Stark effect calculations. In view of these considerations, it would seem useful to examine the theory of the Stark effect in some detail in order to decide which experiments are most interesting and most useful. In this paper, we outline the basic theory of the quadratic Stark effect and discuss the application of our results to various classes of atoms. We confine our attention in the main to that part of the Stark effect which modifies a hyperfine structure transition frequency. W ith one important exception, this means th at we concern ourselves with the tensor part of the polarizability. A detailed discussion of the theory of scalar polarizabilities may be found in Dalgarno (1963). t W ork supported in p a rt b y th e N ational Science Foundation.},

  abstract = {Coherent coupling between distant two-level systems is a fundamental process in several physical contexts, from natural photosynthesis to quantum-information processing, where it enables two-qubit operations. For quantum information, qubits based on electronic degrees of freedom in a solid-state matrix are sensible candidates for scalable, integrated implementations. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying coherent coupling in solids is therefore an essential step in the development of such technology. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a long-range coherent coupling mechanism between individual localized excitons in a 5 nm GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well, introducing the novel tool of two-dimensional nonlinear coherent hyperspectral imaging. The coupling is shown to arise due to a biexcitonic renormalization, rather than a transition dipole (F{\"o}rster) interaction. The long-range nature of the coupling is attributed to the existence of spatially extended exciton states up to the micrometre range, which are admixed in the biexciton state, as revealed in nonlinear imaging. A lthough a variety of approaches are used to generate qubits (quantum two-level systems), those that are to be integrated into practical quantum-information processing devices 1 will most likely be embedded into a solid state matrix 2--5 . Electron pairs 6--8 and individual excitons 9,10 confined in semiconductor quantum dots are both systems to have been investigated in this context. The next essential step towards the semiconductor implementation of quantum information technology is to take advantage of coherent coupling mechanisms between distant qubits to enable controlled two-qubit operations 11 . For this, it is important to understand the physical mechanisms underlying long-range electronic coupling in semiconductors. Here, we study the model system of individual localized excitons in a narrow GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. Substantial coupling of excitons to the light field to enable their optical coherent manipulation and measurement comes at the expense of subnanosecond coherence times. Coherent manipulation on this fast timescale is possible with the tools of coherent ultrafast spectroscopy. Specifically, the recently developed technique of heterodyne spectral interferometry 12,13 (HSI) is capable of detecting a resonantly excited transient coherent nonlinear response, such as four-wave mixing (FWM), in individual quantum systems (see Methods and Supplementary Appendix C). This combines a hetero-dyne detection scheme 14,15},

A radio-frequency phase modulation technique directly references the relative frequency scale to the ground hyperfine splitting of 87 Rb. The 133 Cs 7d 2 D 3/2 hyperfine intervals are used to generate the magnetic dipole coupling constant A = 7.36Ϯ 0.03 MHz and electric quadru-pole coupling constant B = -0.1Ϯ 0.2 MHz. The A coupling constant agrees with a previous measurement, but with an improvement in resolution that is sufficient to serve as a benchmark value for testing high-precision theory. The result for the B coupling constant is the first constraint placed on this parameter.},

  abstract = {Experimental realizations of two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy in the ultraviolet (UV) must so far contend with a limited bandwidth in both the excitation and particularly the probe frequency. The pump bandwidth is at best 1500 cm-1 (full width at half maximum) at a fixed wavelength of 267 nm or 400 cm-1 for tunable pulses. The use of a replica of the pump pulse as a probe limits the observation of photochemical processes to the excitation region and makes the disentanglement of overlapping signal contributions difficult. We show that 2D Fourier transform spectroscopy can be conducted in a shaper-assisted collinear setup comprising fully tunable UV pulse pairs and supercontinuum probe spanning 250--720 nm. The pump pulses are broadened up to a useable spectral coverage of 2000 cm-1 (25 nm at 316 nm) by self-phase modulation in bulk CaF2 and compressed to 18 fs. By referencing the white light probe and eliminating pump stray light contributions, high signal-to-noise ratios even for weak probe intensities are achieved. Data acquisition times as short as 4 min for a selected population time allow the rapid recording of 2D spectra for photolabile biological samples even with the employed 1 kHz laser system. The potential of the setup is demonstrated on two representative molecules: pyrene and 2,2-diphenyl-5,6-benzo(2H)chromene. Well-resolved cross-peaks are observed and the excitation energy dependence of the relaxation processes is revealed.},

The tunability and the narrow bandwidth of the VUV laser are demonstrated in a high-resolution measurement of the (5p)61S0 {$\rightarrow$} (5p)57d[3/2](J = 1) transition of the seven most abundant isotopes of Xe, in which the isotopic shifts could be determined with an accuracy of better than 20 MHz and the hyperfine structure of the transitions of 129Xe and 131Xe could be resolved.

A laser locked to such a narrow optical resonance could serve as a highly stable oscillator for an all-optical atomic clock. However, until recently there was no reliable clockwork mechanism that could count optical frequencies of hundreds of terahertz. Techniques using femtosecond-laser frequency combs, developed within the past few years, have solved this problem. The ability to count optical oscillations of more than 1015 cycles per second facilitates high-precision optical spectroscopy, and has led to the construction of an all-optical atomic clock that is expected eventually to outperform today's state-of-the-art caesium clocks.},

The Fourier spectrum of the beat signal yields evidence of Autler-Townes splitting of the 6P 3/2 , F = 5 hyperfine level and Rabi oscillations on the excited-state transition. A detailed model provides qualitative agreement with the data, giving insight to the physical processes involved.

  abstract = {Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS) has been widely used in a variety of fields due to its high signal-to-noise ratio, simultaneous acquisition of a broad spectrum, and versatility for different radiation sources. Further improvement of the spectroscopic performance will widen its scope of applications. Here, we demonstrate improved spectral resolution by overcoming the time-window size limitation using a mode-locked terahertz (THz) pulse train as precisely periodic pulsed radiation in discrete Fourier transform spectroscopy (dFTS). Since infinitesimal resolution can be achieved at harmonic components of its repetition frequency 1/T when the time-window size is exactly matched to the repetition period T, a combination of dFTS with a spectral interleaving technique achieves a spectral resolution limited only by the spectral interleaving interval. Linewidths narrower than 1/(50T) are fully resolved by THz-dFTS, allowing rotational-transition absorption lines of low-pressure molecular gases to be attributed within a 1.25~MHz band.},

A survey of Stark structures is presented for all of the alkali metals in the vicinity of n = 15. Topics discussed include general methods for evaluating radial matrix elements, the treatment of fine structure, oscillator-strength distribution, scaling laws, the structure of a level anticrossing, and sources of error. Experimental Stark maps are compared with calculated. results for lithium and cesium. Experimental studies of the oscillator-strength distribution within a Stark manifold and the structure of a level anticrossing are also presented.},

The produced vuv pulses are well suited to perform frequency comb spectroscopy with sub-MHz accuracy, which is experimentally verified using a Ramsey-type quantum interference scheme to excite a transition in xenon at 125 nm. The achieved resolution constitutes an improvement of six orders of magnitude compared to previous demonstrations of frequency domain quantum interference in this wavelength range},

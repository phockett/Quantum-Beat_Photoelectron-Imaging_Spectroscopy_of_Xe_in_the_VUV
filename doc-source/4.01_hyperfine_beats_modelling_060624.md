## Formalism

+++

In many physical processes, multiple eigenstates of the system are populated. This may be the result of thermal effects, in which case the states are incoherent, or via a coherent preparation process. In the latter case, the overall state of the system can be considered as a wavepacket, and will evolve in time. Assuming that the wavepacket is created “instantaneously” (with respect to the timescale of system/wavepacket evolution), such as via photon-absorption from a short laser pulse, then the ensuing dynamics is simply dependent on the phase-evolution of the eigenstates which form the superposition state.

A textbook example is the preparation of a superposition of hyperfine states in rare gas atoms via photo-absorption. Typically, a small number of hyperfine states are prepared, and their evolution results in relatively simple wavepacket behaviour, exhibiting clear quantum beats, correlated with a changing alignment of the charge distribution. A full treatment can be found in Sect. 4.7 of Blum's book [1].

+++

For the case of quantum beats from a manifold of (hyperfine) states,
the state multipoles can be expressed as a product of an initial
state, and time-dependent coefficients, as per Eqns. 4.131 and 4.134
in Blum [1]:

\begin{equation}
\langle T(J;t)_{KQ}^{\dagger} \rangle =G(J;t)_{K}\langle T(J)_{KQ}^{\dagger}\rangle
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
G(J;t)_{K}=\frac{1}{2I+1}\sum_{F',F}(2F'+1)(2F+1)\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
J & F' & I\\
F & J & K
\end{array}\right\} ^{2}\cos\left[\frac{(E_{F'}-E_{F})t}{\hbar}\right]
\end{equation}

and $\{...\}$ is a $6j$ symbol, $J$ is the electronic angular momentum,
$I$ the nuclear spin and $F,\,F'$ are hyperfine states that comprise the superposition (wavepacket).

Hence, $\langle T(J)_{KQ}^{\dagger}\rangle$ defines the initial state
of the system after preparation (defined by the state multipoles), and the time-evolution of the superposition
is given by $G(J;t)_{K}$. This contains the angular momentum coupling
between the hyperfine states (defined by the $6j$ symbol), and the
relative phase evolution of the states, expressed in terms of their
energy differences.

## Example: Xe dynamics & alignment ##

+++

Here two examples are given, following the [work in ref. [4]](https://www.authorea.com/users/71114/articles/188337-quantum-beat-photoelectron-imaging-spectroscopy-of-xe-in-the-vuv), in which hyperfine wavepackets were prepared in Xe via excitation around 133 nm. Distinct wavepackets are created in the $^{129}Xe$ and $^{131}Xe$ isotopes, which have $I_{129}=1/2$ and $I_{131}=3/2$ and different hyperfine level structures.

basicXR129.attrs['dataType']='TKQ'
basicXR129.attrs['long_name']='Irreducible tensor parameters'
basicXR129.name = '129Xe'
basicXR129.attrs['abundance'] = 0.264006  # (82)
basicXR129.attrs['states'] = {'JFlist':JFlist, 'Ji':Ji, 'Jf':Jf, 'p':p}

```

The dynamics show the expected, simple, quantum beat structure in
the $\langle T(J;t)_{KQ}^{\dagger}\rangle$. For 1-photon excitation,
with linearly polarised light, only $K=0,\,2,\,Q=0$ terms contribute.
The $(0,0)$ term reflects the total population, hence is temporally-invariant,
while the $(2,0)$ term shows the changing alignment as the wavepacket
evolves. 

The allowed terms, and phase of the quantum beats, depends on the transition - i.e. initial and final $J$ state, and photon angular momentum. For example, with circularly polarised light $M_p = +1$, terms with $K=1$ are also allowed, and are out-of-phase with $K=2$ terms.

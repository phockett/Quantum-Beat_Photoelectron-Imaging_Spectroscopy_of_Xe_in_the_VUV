# Basic fitting for hyperfine beat (stage 1 bootstrap)

For basic fitting, try a stage 1 style bootstrap. In this case, options are:

- "basic" ignore the photoionization dynamics and just try fitting the beat to the $l=4$, ROI=0 case, since it is already pretty close and may be assumed to be directly mapped here. See {ref}`page:basic-fitting`.
- "advanced" set (arbitrary) parameters per final state for the probe, and fit these plus the hyperfine beat model parameters. This should allow for a match to a single set of hyperfine parameters for all observables, and fulfil the stage 1 bootstrap criteria. See {ref}`page:advanced-fitting`.
